# Hosted Projects

### This repository links to a few hosted webpages I've created. They all make use of APIs so only the final product is shown.

https://katherine-weather.netlify.app/
This page uses a weather api to display the local 5-day forecast.

https://katherine-trip-planner.netlify.app/
This page allows you to search an origin and destination (point of interest, address, etc.) and find the next bus route available between them.

https://winnipeg-transit-api.netlify.app/
This page lets you search for a street and displays the next two busses for each stop along that street. May not work if no busses are found.
